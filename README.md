# Terraform Powered Multi-Cloud Architecture
## Key Objectives
In this architecture, three essential infrastructure components will be deployed on each cloud platform:

Virtual Machine Instance: A VM instance is created to provide computing resources on each platform, demonstrating Terraformâ€™s ability to manage compute instances in AWS, Azure, and GCP.
Virtual Private Cloud (VPC): A network is established on each cloud platform to ensure secure and isolated environments for resources, allowing cross-platform communication within the private network.
Database Instance: A managed database service will be provisioned on each platform, providing a consistent data layer across the cloud environments.
